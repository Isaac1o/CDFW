@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 It isn’t about being built up. It is the location that is the issue. Glendale is just too far out for most of their fan base. They are supposed to have another vote on the Coyotes proposal in the future.	
"@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 As I mentioned before, Glendale is a long way from the Coyotes fanbase in Scottsdale and Phoenix. Hard to get to games if you are familiar with the heavy traffic  in Phoenix. Just imagine having to drive to Escondido from San diego in rush hour traffic."	
"@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 There are many NHL fans that wonder why the NHL commissioner is so determined to keep the Coyotes in AZ. Since he works for the NHL owners, maybe it is those owners that don’t want to lose the Phoenix market."	
"@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 The process for getting an arena built in Tempe will be one to follow. If the other NHL owners are ok with what the Coyotes are doing, they must know something about the process we don’t."	
@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 Far from it. Chances of them relocating I would say are small. I would say the deal the Coyotes made with ASU gives them the time needed to hammer out a deal for a new Tempe arena.	
@SDPNLCS2022 @mpotter74 I would start paying attention to the situation in Calgary with the Flames. Coyotes are rubber stamped for Houston if the arena effort in Tempe fails.

@StJeromeFan @coyote_cares @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man @USCCB So you disagree with the USCCB and various other church bodies around the world that have come to the agreement that those baptisms are valid? Because I literally shared the document. There is no mention of I vs We… just the Trinitarian formula.	
"@StJeromeFan @coyote_cares @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man If the Church recognizes the baptism of another for these reasons, it should also recognize those done by their own priest for those reasons. Have they said said I over We for their own, yes, but they have ALSO said “flowing water” and “Trinitarian formula” is valid."	
"@StJeromeFan @coyote_cares @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man I keep bringing it up because the Catholic Church has agreed that, with flowing water, is a valid baptism. Those from other faith traditions do not need to be baptized again because they already are."	
"@StJeromeFan @coyote_cares @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man To my knowledge, the Church has not voided the mutual agreements with other churches in various countries since the conference where they decided on We vs I. The @USCCB doesn’t have a newer document and I have not seen any RCIA candidates be rebaptized in recent years."	
"@StJeromeFan @coyote_cares @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man I said above that the I/We is a Catholic language thing, not a Trinitarian formula thing. If we recognize the baptisms of other faith traditions that use the Trinitarian formula as valid, it logically follows that these are also valid. Like, correct the priest and move on."

"@coyote_cares @StJeromeFan @runclepennybags @Goodtweet_man The I is not part of the Trinitarian formula. It’s only part of the Catholic language.
