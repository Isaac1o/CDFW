Good Morning Twitter Family 🤩✨   \n2  At this moment, I have a neighbor that lives 750 away. He keeps his two Labrador retrievers in a 15’ish square pen with a roof outside at night. How do I know this? Because I came hear them barking. Constantly. \\n\\nApparently they just won a debate with the coyotes. https://t.co/oJV5Swuc3f   \n3   @AstroBackyard Had the coyotes barking within a few hundred feet of me in Joshua Tree tonight. I shined a light in their direction to let them know I’m aware of them. Oddly, one sounded like a dog.\\n\\nWhat freaked me out more were the hikers somewhere in the dark. I just heard foot steps!   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                              really just saw a coyote cross the street and stare at me as i drove by 😭😭😭 what the, la habra heights   \n\n       tweet_id hashtags       user_id        username         location  \\\n0  1.460000e+18       []  9.202440e+08  CoyoteWatchCAN     Ontario, CA    \n1  1.460000e+18       []  1.460000e+18   coyote_kissa1     Pasadena, CA   \n2  1.460000e+18       []  1.330000e+18   DavidCMaybury       Perris, CA   \n3  1.460000e+18       []  6.883438e+07     darrenreely  Los Angeles, CA   \n4  1.460000e+18       []  2.323440e+09      angeIiques          she/her   \n\n   num_followers  geo_enabled  long  lat  relevant  neg_sent_score  \\\n0           4420         True   NaN  NaN       0.0           0.000   \n1             57        False   NaN  NaN       0.0           0.000   \n2            438         True   NaN  NaN       1.0           0.000   \n3            147         True   NaN  NaN       1.0           0.039   \n4            109         True   NaN  NaN       1.0           0.256   \n\n   neu_sent_score  pos_sent_score  compound_sent_score sent_class  \n0           0.912           0.088               0.2023   positive  \n1           0.634           0.366               0.6369   positive  \n2           0.930           0.070               0.5719   positive  \n3           0.912           0.049               0.1511   positive  \n4           0.744           0.000              -0.8519   negative  ",
